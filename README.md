**Welcome to ‘Future Link’

**What is Future Link?**

Future link is a desktop application that seeks to connect users with the all-too-unknown future, providing guidance for decisions that many people find to be overwhelming

**How does it work?**

Future link contains a variety of functions to help a user make necessary future-defining decisions, including the following:

**Investment Strategies:**

Through inputs of how much money you currently have invested your portfolio, and how much more you will invest for a specified amount of time. This will compile your data into a graph, demonstrating the growth of your money given trends in common investments, as well as detailing the pros and cons of each. 

**Budgeting:**

The program uses the information stored about a user’s Salary and Location, and generates a pie chart detailing how much of a salary should go to different categories: “Bills”, “Investments”, “Grocery”, “Gas”, and “Extras”. 

**Locations:**

Utilizing a series of prompts, the user adjusts the ‘weight’ of variables: “Money”,” Safety”, and “Recreation”, which are adjusted through each prompt. The users’ inputs are then put into the predictive “KNN” Algorithm, which utilizes Euclidean distance between points in a cluster of plots, and shows the top 5 states to live in, as well as the 5 that the user would like the least, and the option to show the full list.

**Education/Career:**

Utilizing a series of prompts, the program determines a career shift, or a complete career change dependent on the series of questions. An example for a career change would be: Current: Garbage man, No degree | Suggestion on interests: Art Degree, Graphic Designer. An example of career shift: Current: Software Engineer | Suggestion: Data Scientist
