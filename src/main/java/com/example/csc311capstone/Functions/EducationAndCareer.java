 * Help guide the user to a work environment more suitable to them, to hopefully give them their motivation back.
 * This could come in one of 2 outcomes:
 *
 * -	A shift in employment paradigm, which has related work field experience requirements, which would allow for a guide to a
 * seamless transition from one workstyle to another.
 *
 * -	A realistic complete reset on work/career, and the fastest ways to get back into the workforce in a different field.
